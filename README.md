This is a simple project utilising traditional machine learning classification task to predict whether a patient have diabetes or not. 

The app for this project has been deployed as a streamlit application, which can be viewed here: https://sofeanoh-sofeanoh-diabetes-application-2zi2qt.streamlit.app/

Alternatively, you can clone the repository and run the command "streamlit run application.py" on your command prompt/terminal (ensure you have streamlit installed beforehand!)
